# jac-do-do-list
üöÄ Jac ToDo Master: A Command-Line Organizer
Welcome to the future of task management! This is a simple, persistence-enabled ToDo List application built entirely in Jac, the language for building hyper-graphical applications.

This project was developed for a [Insert Your Class Name or Course ID Here] assignment.

‚ú® Features
Persistence: Tasks are stored on the graph (root node) and remain saved even after you quit the application and restart.

Simple Command Interface: Easy-to-use menu driven by a single walker.

External Integration: Leverages the impl feature to seamlessly call standard Python functions (utils.py) for date formatting and timestamp generation.

üèÉ Getting Started (How to Run It)
Prerequisites
You must have the Jac compiler installed.

Install Jac:

pip3 install jaclang

Clone the Repository:

git clone [Your GitHub URL Here]
cd jac_todo_app

Execution
Ensure you are inside the jac_todo_app folder, then use the following command to run the application:

# This is the guaranteed way to execute the Jac module using Python 3:
python3 -m jac run todo.jac

üí° Troubleshooting (The "Command Refused" Fix)
If you encounter the error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named jac even after installing, it means your python3 command is not using the same Python environment where jaclang was installed.

Here are quick solutions to try:

Try using python instead of python3:

python -m jac run todo.jac

Ensure Virtual Environment is Active: If you are using a tool like venv or conda, make sure you have activated the environment before attempting to run the command.
